Hi there!

I'm currently a Masters Student in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I am currently advised by Prof. [Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/). 

My research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning, Biology and Statistics. I am interested both in **applying machine learning and statistics for biological applications** and **using biologically inspired ideas to improve machine learning and statistical techniques**. Currently, I am working on incorporating group information to better model Healthcare Associated Infections.

Previously, I was an Applied AI Intern at [Netomi](https://www.netomi.com/) where I was mentored with Dr. [Partho Nath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/partho-nath/). I worked on developing semi-supervised clustering methods to better analyze large customer service ticket datasets.

In the Summer of 2020, I was a SURF Intern at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) where I was advised by Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and developed energy-aware algorithms to schedule precedence constrained tasks on multiple servers.

I finished my undergraduate studies at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) where I completed my Honors thesis with Prof. [Daniel Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/) and worked on developing adversarial robust deep neural networks.

Other than research, I'm an avid reader üìö and an overenthusiastic amateur cricket player üèè. 
The quickest way to reach me would be email.
